You might be right if what the printer\nsystem is handed over is just a plain text file. Then, the printing system\ncan do whatever it wants to do (adding header, footer with page number,\ntitle, etc). However, what Netscape gives the printing system is, in\nUnix/X11, a postscript file. Do you think the printer system has to/can\nmanipulate this postscript file (e.g. resizing the whole page and adding\nheader and footer)?  Things like n-page up, duplex printing, banner page\nwith title are certainly in the realm of the printing system. However,\nadding headers and footer with the page title, page number, date, the\nURL of the page has to be taken care of by Mozilla. Please, also note\nthat Unix/X11 version offers a way to print to a file. If the printing\nsystem has to add header and footer, PS file obtained by \'printing to\na file\' would be different from the hardcopy.\n\n\nAD> So that\'s why Unix and Windows printouts differ: Mozilla just passes this\nAD> information to the Windows printer and omits it on Unix.

I\'ve been also wondering\nwhy Windows version of NS can add date, page number, URL (which is very\nhandy), title while Unix/X11 version can\'t.\n\n  When I printed out with 2001-04-03 build for Linux, I was pleasantly\nsuprised to see the page title, page number ( x of y ) and date (current)\nwere printed in header and footer. However, there\'s still one item\nmissing which is present in print-out of MS-Windows version, which is\nthe URL of the page being printed. Now, I got really curious as to why\non earth  MS-Windows version can print all four items (title, url, date,\nand page number) while Unix/X11 version can only three of them (title,\ndate and page number). I guess this(printing out URL as well in Unix/X11\nversion of Mozilla) should be an easy fix.\n\n   Jungshik Shin',0.00,0,1,662891,0,NULL,0,'2001-04-06 14:18:18'),(67742,25631,'\nThe last builds I have tries are as follows:\n\n20010321: Makefile broken, but PSM Good when compiled.\n20010408: Makefile good.

For example, \"ImapMail/mail/rules.dat\" vs\n\"/var/foo/mail/rules.dat\".  Perhaps this could be implemented as\nresource://profile/ImapMail/mail/rules.dat vs file:///var/foo/mail/rules.dat? \nWould that be a bad idea?\n\n2) From a UI perspective, I think the user should be shown only absolute paths,\nand they should be converted to relative paths if they are within the profile\ndir.  The average user won\'t notice a difference, until they move their profile\ndir and find that everything still works.\n\n3) Mac OS uses \":\" as a path seperator and \"/\" is a valid character in a\nfilename.  If we\'re storing paths as URLs, \"Folder:file/name.txt\" can just be\nencoded as \"Folder/file%2Fname.txt\" which probably already works in file://\nURLs.

I\'ve been using Mozilla a few months, starting with a 0.9\nrelease, moving to 1.0 and finally 1.1\n\nHear my saga...\n\nI run a home business and we had set up all the Windows98 computers to save all\nuser data to an NT server.  This means everything, the MyDocuments folder,\nFavorites for IE, Navigator profiles, Outlook email folders, etc.  The reason we\ndid this is because I don\'t want work stopping because a computer is fubar\'d (we\ncan\'t ghost easily because each machine ahs different hardware - we\'re using a\nlot of used equipment).  If I have a work deadline, and my machine gets toasted,\nI need to be able to move to another machine, login and have everything, and go\nto work ASAP.  All our machines were setup so anyone could login and work on any\nof them as needed.\n\nWhen we decided to move to Mozilla for browsing, mail, news and calendaring, we\nset up all the profiles on the same server.  At the same time, we set up our own\nIMAP on a Redhat server and gathered our email via fetchmail and pointed to our\nIMAP server.  This worked great.  Even in the field with a laptop (different\nprofile, of course), I just hit my IMAP server and had access to all my email.\n\nThen we moved to a very rural location where we could not get cable, DSL or\nwireless.  Being back on dial-up meant I could not access our IMAP server away\nfrom home.  So I reconfigured Mozilla to grab my email via POP, turned off\nfetchmail, and manually moved all my email from the IMAP folders to the newly\ncreated Mozilla mail folders via the mail-and-news application.  \n\nI did this on a stationary PC at home.  I then copied the profile to my laptop.\n Since Mozilla was entirely fubar\'d, and a reinstall didn\'t help, I rebuilt my\nlaptop from scratch.  Then I then wrote a little DOS batch file to copy the\nentire profile from my home box (which is on a network server) to my laptop\nmanually and vice-versa (and copy a few other things I need).\n\nBasically, it took me over a week, and way more research than was necessary, to\nfix my laptop due to all the absolute paths in various files within the profile.\n In spite of folders for each POP address already present, Mozilla made new ones\nand I had to manually change the directory in each case.\n\nIt\'s taken me scores of hours to get Mozilla working properly on both boxes, and\nmy batch files are about ten times longer than necessary since I have to specify\nthe exact path of every single file to be copied (now that I know which are safe\nto copy and which are not).  \n\nAnd once that was working properly, Mozilla crashed on every form submission (an\n*entire* crash of all applications) due to some problem with copying the .w and\n.s files.\n\nAt a minimum, the location of the main profile directory needs to exist in one\nhuman-editable file... all other paths should be relative to it.  \n\nAnd frankly, the profile manager should have a button to click to copy a profile\nfrom wherever it actually is to *exactly* the directory where I want it to be -\nand auto-convert anything that eneds to be converted.  \n\nI should not have needed to learn this much about Mozilla and what all the\nspecific files do in order to copy a profile.  It\'s been a bit much, and I can\'t\nsee the average user going through all this.  And it makes Mozilla look bad, my\nco-workers know I am the only Mozilla person around, and also know I have been\nunable to do my email at work for a few weeks now.\n\nI\'m not writing to criticize, I don\'t know enough programming to actually help.\n Sorry.  I\'m writing to clarify the types of issues that come up.  I need to\nstore my profile on a server *and* on a local machine *and* be able to\nsynchronize the two.

This is a more important issue for IMAP (and maybe other mail types, but not POP) where the mail can be filtered into folders on the server.\n\nSuppression of notification when mail moved to certain folders is bug 224573; and suppression of notification for certain mail accounts is bug 104809.  Both features could be handled via a filter suppressing notification on a per-message basis, altho I think a per-account setting would be a reasonable feature to implement above and beyond \n\nI think the primary aspect of this bug is a filter action to control notification.  There are many aspects of this that could be implemented; perhaps the action could be:\n  Notify as:     None, Normal, Priority\nwhere Normal is the default action taken if no filters change the notification status.  If *all* new items are filtered with Notify As, None, then no new notification occurs.  If *any* new item is filtered with Notify As, Priority,\nthen the priority alert would apply -- a different sound, a colored tray icon.\n\nThis could obviously be much more complex, with individually configurable sounds, slide-up appearance, and tray-icon appearance, and there are many RFEs to that effect.  Also note that TB has implemented a different alert popup (in Windows, anyway) that shows information about the new messages, and that could also be finetuned even further with filters, if these were allowed to grow to that level of complexity.  I think in terms of maintainability and overall usefulness, a three-level scheme as I propose is a decent compromise; it would cover bug 190989, bug 219510, and possibly others I haven\'t found.',0.00,0,0,3036070,0,NULL,0,'2006-11-12 19:06:26'),(367518,31324,'User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1\nBuild Identifier: \n\nFor some reason, suddendly, parts of the files of my email accounts were gone.\n(missed inbox, outbox, etc...)\nI saw this, because I compared with a backup.\nI did a re-install, re-created my profile and tried to get my mailboxes back using the backup and the descriptions at :\nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Importing_and_exporting_your_mail#Manually_importing_and_exporting\nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Migrating_settings_to_a_new_profile\n\nMy mailboxes still aren\'t showing.\nSo apart from data loss, the recovery procedure is \na) incomplete\nb) I\'ve forgotten something\nc) we\'ve run into a new situation\n\nWhat bothers me very much is the absence of an importing tool for Thunderbird mailboxes.

Unless of course we\ndon\'t want that; but not saving this value for next startups seems inconsistent\nwith what we do in other parts of the UI.\n\nExample: we put a check mark besides View > Status Bar to indicate that the\nstatus bar is shown.  We save this value for next startups.  If we put a check\nmark next to the \"Private Browsing Mode\" menu item, the users would expect the\n\"check mark\" to be preserved in the next startup, and may assume that it is and\ngets bitten later on when she discovers that this value has not been saved.\n\nOr am I totally missing something here?\n\n> * Cookies\n> \n> This is a pretty painful impl, since this would mean that you\'ll lose cookies\n> that you had before you started in private browsing mode and accessed while\n> you\'re there.

Achieves the same thing, but means link coloring\n> etc still work during the session.  I\'m not sure if we can suppress flushing to\n> disk, but if not I\'m not as concerned about \"must never touch magnetic media\"\n> as some are.\n\nTwo concerns:\n\n1. The goal here is to respect user\'s privacy.  Suppose that the user enters\nthe private browsing mode, and performs a Google search and navigates to one of\nthe results in a new tab.  Now, if someone sees the Google results page over\nthe user\'s shoulders, they would immediately figure out what page the user has\nvisited.  If I want to get over-paranoid, I could even imagine them to memorize\nthe page title and then do a Google search of their own to find out exactly\nwhat the user has viewed in their private browsing mode...\n\n2. A more serious issue: if we write the URLs to the Places DB, with the\nintention of clearing them off later, and in between we crash or get closed, on\nthe next startup, the URLs visited in the *private* mode exist in the DB (and\nwe guarantee that the DB survives our crash...).  Even if we add code to handle\nthat in the startup, what happens if someone takes the raw sqlite DB file from\nthe user\'s profile, and open it in their own app/viewer?\n\nThe paragraph I quote below from <http://wiki.mozilla.org/PrivateBrowsing>\nseems to be very relevant here:\n\n\"By choosing to write *some* data to disk (perhaps in an encrypted format) we\nhave broken a clear and easy to understand contract between Firefox and the\nuser. The user / security expert will not be sure that there is no security\nrisk.\"\n\nWe don\'t want that, I guess.  Not getting visited link colors is something that\nthe ordinary user may not even notice (there are a lot of sites which disable\nour default coloring via CSS) and the advanced user will appreciate (see point\n1 above).  And we can document that this is intentional in the user docs for\nthe private browsing feature...\n\n> * Cache\n> \n> Totally disabling cache feels like a mistake.  Why not just disable the disk\n> cache, and clear memory cache before re-enabling disk cache?  (biesi, does\n> disabling the disk cache preclude reloading from disk on exit of private\n> browsing?)\n\nI guess this is the right approach here...',0.00,0,0,3433238,0,NULL,0,'2008-01-10 20:47:04'),(248970,251051,'(In reply to comment #31)\n> (In reply to comment #30)\n> > Shawn: I\'m afraid that the link above may not point to what you intended to say\n> > any more.\n> \n> fyi, you can use bonsai to figure it out - load up the cvs log for the file:\n> http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvslog.cgi?file=/mozilla/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/content/downloads.js&rev=HEAD&mark=1.130\n> find the appropriate revision based on date, click on the linkified revision\n> number, click on \'blame\' at the bottom of the diff screen, then find the\n> appropriate line number.\n\nThanks for the tip!\n\n> for this reason, it\'s always better to provide bonsai links to a particular\n> revision & line number - that way, they don\'t change with time. ;)\n\nAgreed!

Here are two examples:\n\n-Alex is shopping for an engagement ring, so he enters into private browsing mode and loads amazon.com.  Amazon recognizes Alex based on the cookies stored in his profile, and remembers that he spent the afternoon looking for engagement rings.  The next day Alex\'s soon to be fiancee sits down at his computer and loads up amazon.com (while not in private browsing mode) and sees a homepage full of \"Other people who shopped for engagement rings looked at these rings as well! and Here is your recent shopping history!\"\n\n-Anna is trying to plan a surprise vacation for Alex.  Not knowing the implementation details of cookies, data stored on a server, and the way Firefox treats private browsing mode, she turns on private browsing mode and begins to research exotic tropical locations.  Using a cookie stored in her profile, Google Web History captures every search she does, not realizing that she is interested in privacy because she never logged out of her google account.  Alex sits down at Anna\'s computer and her Web History widget on her iGoogle home page exposes every search that she has done.\n\nI can see users thinking that \"privacy means privacy\" and since they don\'t really get how all of this stuff works, situations like those two being rather common on shared computers.

This leads me to think that we should probably\n> block access to cookies when the user is in private browsing mode.\n\nHmm, interesting use cases.  Let\'s do an item by item analysis based on such a viewpoint.\n\nWe have the following items that should be affected by private browsing (feel free to add to the list if I\'m missing anything):\n\n* Cache: we disable disk and offline caches, and continue using the memory cache.  The memory cache may contain items specific to user\'s identity (for example, a page sent by a web application which is dynamically generated using user\'s cookie, and has stayed in the cache).  Therefore, we may want to clear the memory cache before proceeding in the private browsing mode as well.  The current implementation empties the memory cache before leaving the private browsing mode, so that no content from the private session lives in the memory after it.\n\n* History: we simply disable adding new history items in the private browsing mode.  The previously existing history items are usable though.  The URLs stored in the history may contain session IDs, etc. (think of sites which embed session IDs in URLs instead of cookies), but disabling history completely does not seem like a good option.\n\n* Form AutoComplete: we disable adding new form autocomplete items in private browsing mode, but using previously stored items is allowed.  I can\'t think of why this may be a possible privacy concern...\n\n* Download Manager: we disable keeping downloaded items in the downloads history in the private browsing mode, but old items remain there, which looks innocent.\n\n* Cookies: we currently allow cookies to be saved in the private browsing mode, and delete them once we\'re leaving this mode.  The entire collection of cookies is usable in private browsing mode.  This implementation is not good (see the issues in comment 21), but I have not yet worked on this part at all (I\'m waiting on bug 411952...).  The implementation you suggest in comment 56 actually seems good enough: access to the existing cookies should be blocked, but new cookies should be able to be saved to and restored from memory while in private browsing mode.  Exiting this mode will delete the in-memory temporary cookies table, and will switch to the default set of cookies for use in normal browsing mode.  The implementation of such behavior is more difficult than the existing plan, but it may be worth it (I\'m OK with the implementation challenge.)\n\n* Session Store: the session store in private browsing mode is prevented from writing anything to disk, but maintains its own memory data collections.  Upon leaving this mode, the entire data collected throughout this mode is dumped, and the data is collected once again.  Upon entering the private browsing mode, the previously collected session store data is available (for example, you can undo closed tabs), which is no bigger a privacy risk than the previously stored history items being accessible.  (BTW, now that I think of it, Session Store should restore its exact data from the last snapshot before entering the private browsing mode, and then scan for newly added/changed tabs and windows.  This way the recently closed tabs at the start of the private browsing session are available after exiting it.  I\'ll implement this in a future version of the patch.)\n\n* Password Manager: the password manager should not prompt to save new login info in the private browsing mode, but should be able to autofill form elements with previously stored info.  This is exactly like the Form History and I think it\'s OK.\n\n* Permissions Manager: the permissions manager should be prevented from storing new permissions in the private browsing mode (because storing new permissions could reveal sites visited in the private browsing mode.)  Respecting previously stored permissions should be OK (like the case of Form History).  BTW I\'m currently working on this, and I\'ll post a patch shortly.\n\n* Certificate Manager: the certificate exceptions should not be stored in the private browsing mode (like the case for Permissions Manager).  Respecting previously stored exceptions should be OK (like the case of Permissions Manager).\n\n* Add-ons Install Whitelist: The same goes here like Permissions Manager and Certificate Manager.  (BTW, wasn\'t add-ons install whitelist supposed to be eliminated in Firefox 3?  What is the status of it?  Should I invest time on working on it in this bug?)\n\n* Error Console: the error console should be prevented from accepting messages while in private browsing mode, because many messages contain site URLs.  Viewing the previous messages from normal browsing modes should not be a privacy concern.\n\nComments/suggestions/criticisms are most welcome!',0.00,0,0,3435638,0,NULL,0,'2008-01-12 18:23:15'),(248970,251051,'This patch implements the backend changes in the nsPermissionManager, and also disabled the UI elements responsible for changing permissions in the browser code.

For example, for the permissions service, my patch changes the nsPermissionManager slightly, and also disables any place in the UI which is used to add modify anything in nsPermissionManager.  But I\'m not sure how a similar \"higher-level\" approach can be taken for cache and cookie services, since they are accessed by other modules in netwerk, and patching the UI won\'t work in those cases (at least, I can\'t see how it would work.)\n\n> a better approach would be to back up the original cookie and db files to a\n> known location, do the private browsing, and then restore them. you\'ll have to\n> figure out what to do in event of crash, though - we don\'t want that private\n> data being left around, or orphaned.\n\nHmm, IINM, as long as we write the cookies on disk (no matter in the original or in a new db file), we are risking the information to get leaked.  There is not much we can do in case of a crash, and there is even less that can be done in case Firefox is \"end-tasked\" without a chance to do any cleanup.  And by using sqlite as the backend, we ensure that the data is left in a usable state on the disk, so we can\'t even hope for it to get corrupted.  :-)\n\nThis is why I think an approach such as comment 56 is better in this regard (I\'m talking about the having an in-memory DB part, not necessarily avoiding using the existing cookies.)',0.00,0,0,3436053,0,NULL,0,'2008-01-13 08:36:32'),(248970,251051,'(In reply to comment #62)\n> (From update of attachment 296738 [details])\n> >Index: toolkit/components/downloads/src/nsDownloadManager.cpp\n> >+  // If the user is in private browsing mode, delete the download record when\n> >+  // completed\n> >+  PRBool privMode = PR_FALSE;\n> >+  pref->GetBoolPref(PREF_PRIVATEBROWSING, &privMode);\n> >+  if (privMode)\n> >+    return 0;\n> >+\n> please grab the result of GetBoolPref, and in the if statement, check if it was\n> successful as well.\n\nThe idea here (and in other parts of the patch) is to assume that we are not in the safe browsing mode, and try to prove otherwise.

So, I guess this removes the dependency on bug 411952...\n\nThe only thing which needs to be decided before I can come up with a patch is if we want to keep the previously stored cookies around, or start from scratch as Alex suggested in comment 56.  Faaborg, Beltzner, Mconnor: any ideas?\n\n> permission manager works identically. although by \"opening a new connection\"\n> you\'re really clearing the existing in-memory table, and then calling InitDB()\n> to reload the on-disk data.\n\nYeah, that is what we would want.  This makes the whole UI changes to disable setting new permissions introduced in patch 6 redundant as well: users *will* be able to set new permissions in the private browsing mode, only those new permissions would last until the end of their private browsing session, and would get vanished right after they exit the private browsing session.\n\nBTW, this makes me think that the private browsing should not last between browser session restarts.  Think of what would happen to the cookies if the user closes the browser without exiting the private browsing mode...  They would get lost (because they are stored in memory.)  I think this gives me a clear idea why private browsing mode should not be retained after starting the browser.  If we have an indicator in the primary UI (like Alex suggested in comment 41) then this won\'t be much of an issue, because the user will know immediately that she\'s no longer in the private browsing mode after she restarts the browser.  And it makes the observer/notification implementation suggested by mconnor and Justin before viable.  We\'ll probably want a component which runs as a service which could be queried for the state of the private browsing mode, and can be used to initiate the browsing mode.  This component can be used for all higher level code (possibly excluding the netwerk/permission code, which can use raw observers.)\n\nThis sounds like quite a bit of work, but I\'ll try to come up with a new patch shortly.',0.00,0,0,3436086,0,NULL,0,'2008-01-13 09:30:38'),(248970,251051,'(In reply to comment #69)\n> indeed! the cookie service effectively has two data stores - on-disk and\n> in-memory. on loading a profile, it reads data from the on-disk db into memory,\n> and from that point on keeps them synced.

Give the user a \"clean\" session by not using any previously used cookies whatsoever.  This is just like the case where they create a new profile and use it to browse the web.  The cookies can be stored during user\'s private browsing session.  After the user exits, any cookies stored will be discarded.  All cookies are stored only in memory, so no track of user\'s actions are saved to disk.\n\n2.

(I\'m most worried about the \"QA hasn\'t been planning on testing this mode\" part.)\n\nAlso, I guess this won\'t be something which could be expected to land in a 3.0.x release, right?  All this haste is because I know many users which would appreciate a lot if their browser provided private browsing mode capability.

Should this warning be in the UI, or in the docs, or both?\n\nImaginative answer: would it be possible to make some changes to the core Mozilla I/O code, so that when the private browsing mode is turned on, the I/O subsystem (part of it which handles in-profile data files) creates a new access path to the profile data: a copy-on-write (COW) scheme, which copies the modified data to memory, and reads such data from memory later on, until the private mode is switched off, which would cause the in-memory copies of data to be discarded, and the I/O handles restored to make further I/O happen on disk like usual?\n\nOpen questions:\n1) Is this possible at all, from an architectural point of view?  (Are there any high-level docs available on the I/O architecture in Mozilla, designed for someone who\'s not a guru in that field, i.e., me?)\n2) What to do with APIs which can\'t make the above requirement?  (What happens when a file grows in private browsing mode, and some code seeks into the newly appended portion, for example?)\n3) Would it be possible to implement this from a logical point of view?  (How would code react to gets its storage \"swapped\" in and out from underneath it?)\n4) How much of the code which accesses the filesystem uses Mozilla\'s I/O facilities?

MSG_FLAG_NEW is indirectly tied to BIFF notification and clearing.\n\nSo what happens when we restrict the class of messages that do BIFF notification? Do we continue to tie this to MSG_FLAG_NEW? That would mean that the NEW flag would only occur on messages that have been filtered to perform BIFF notification. But I believe that the existing NEW flag on messages and folders is useful, and should be preserved even when BIFF notification is modified by a filter.\n\nSo the approach that I propose is to introduce a new message flag MSG_FLAG_BIFF that would be used for BIFF control, and be the subject of this current bug. The existing MSG_FLAG_NEW flag will continue to operate in roughly the same way that it does currently (though I will probably propose in another bug that MSG_FLAG_NEW be preserved across mail sessions.)\n\nIf this path is followed, then there may be a need to identify which folders and messages are the one that caused the BIFF notification. I propose that the existing folder and message decoration associated with MSG_FLAG_NEW and BIFF state be modified to show a subtle difference between NEW and BIFF messages. That might be a larger or bolder decoration for the BIFF messages. That change in folder and message decoration will not be part of this current bug however.\n\nCurrently, message and folder BIFF state is spread between four variables: an array kept in the database, an array kept in the folder, a hasNewMessages boolean, and a count of new messages. The responsibility to maintain hasNewMessages and the new message count is separate from the flag, so each message editor has to set those independently. Prior to completing this bug, I want to simplify and consolidate that process somewhat, at the same time preparing for a possible MSG_FLAG_BIFF. That groundwork is being laid in bug 441932.',0.00,0,0,3688401,0,NULL,0,'2008-07-02 06:40:29'),(11040,135518,'',0.00,0,0,3688836,2,'443110',0,'2008-07-02 15:19:05'),(11040,4410,'NEW and BIFF are strongly tied together, I would say, and I\'m not convinced that we should separate them. If we leave them tied together, all the filter action would have to do is clear the NEW flag on the message. I believe when the user says they don\'t want to be notified about a new message, they don\'t want it to appear as a new message. If you introduce this new concept of BIFF, does the new message appear in the tooltip for the folder? Presumably not, since I think that should match the new mail alert...and the new message alert will only show messages that have the biff flag set, not the new flag.

I would appreciate though any comments you have on the more immediate issue, at least for this bug, of separating \"New\" from \"Biff\", allowing more direct control of Biff through filters (this bug) and possibly as a folder property (not this bug), while keeping New as the indicator of \"You haven\'t seen this message yet in the message pane\". The tray indicator would match BIFF. The tooltip per folder would match NEW. At the moment for this bug, NEW would not persist over sessions - though it would be more valuable if it did, and that\'s where I\'m headed. It\'s particularly useful for large volume email lists, RSS feeds, and newsgroups where I want to see what\'s happened since the last time that I opened the message pane.\n\n> However, several longstanding bugs -- the tray icon and account-New flag\n> persisting when shouldn\'t (all new messages moved to a different account and\n> read there), or clearing when shouldn\'t (explicit Get New Messages, or in the\n> suite, opening a new mail window), and those several about erroneous New count\n> display in the alert and the tooltip -- all make the distinction less useful\n> than it could be.\n> \n\nMy work-in-process patch for bug 441932 solves some of the issues involving NEW that I am aware of involving folder-level counts and flags.

I\'d really like to get to the point where we have precise control of when BIFF goes off - and have a virtual search folder that shows exactly what messages triggered the current notification. Which will bring up another point - when do you clear the BIFF flag? The existing code is inconsistent, which is why for example \"explicit Get New Messages\" clears NEW in some cases.

I approached the problem from the point of view that any amount of data that the browser leaks on to the disk or the network that is either uniquely identifying, can be used to build a random identifier, or indicative of their history is a vulnerability (See https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/#adversary and https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/#requirements).\n\nWhile this was a different approach that seems to have been taken from this bug (which seems to have been attacked primarily from a usability perspective), it seems to have led us to similar conclusions.\n\nI\'ve documented everything I have learned and implemented in the Torbutton design document here: https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/\n\nA couple of comments I can give from experience that weren\'t covered in your above discussion, or that I\'d just like to re-emphasize:\n\n0. Pages loaded in non-private mode can do all sorts of automatic network activity, set timers, attempt to re-authenticate, send unique identifiers stored in \'DOM Storage\', etc etc during private mode.\n\n1. Content window Javascript can access session history to navigate back and forward for the user to cause the local network (in our case the exit node) to learn a bit about their most recently accessed private or non-private session history.\n\n2. Formfill and password saving can write private data to disk, and read it back where content window Javascript can inspect the values.\n\n3. Livemarks refreshes currently cannot be disabled, and will still happen in the background during private mode (Bug 436250), exposing potentially private data to the local network (such as wikipedia pages you are an editor of, etc)\n\n4. Plugins have their own cookies that can still be transmitted in private mode (see http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html).\n\n5. Users hate it when a private mode does anything to permanently alter any of their non-private data. The only way to do this and have it ever be used is to isolate the non-private data so that it can\'t be touched during private mode, but is restored upon entrance back into non-private mode.\n\n6. Custom SSL certificates are still available and can be probed for.\n\n7. (Already covered briefly, would like to re-emphasize): History disclosure is a big big problem (see http://gemal.dk/browserspy/css.html and http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history.cgi http://www.mikeonads.com/2008/07/13/using-your-browser-url-history-estimate-gender/), \nbut it must not be solved by damaging the user\'s current stored history, or even \nmaking it inaccessible.\n\n8. Private mode should also be a pref in addition to an observer event, so that components and windows loaded after the transition can still determine the current mode.\n\n\nI\'ve also cataloged a list of Firefox bugs that make much of the above difficult under the current version of Firefox: https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/#FirefoxBugs\n\n',0.00,0,0,3724785,0,NULL,0,'2008-07-31 17:56:52'),(248970,251051,'A while back Beltzner told me that the drivers feel that the risk in the approach I\'ve took in my patches on this bug is too high and that they\'re more willing to take a Places-based solution.

Eudora doesn\'t have a separate message status of new.  Instead it bolds mailbox names that have unread mail that are newer than 5 days (solves the old mail problem that bienvenu mentions above, and also persists across sessions), opens up mailboxes that get new mail put in them, and it automatically selects the first unread message at the end of a mailbox when its opened up.  I\'ve got these last two items mostly working in Penelope already.  One common usage model is that new messages get filtered in to mailboxes, which are then automatically opened up.  You then close the mailboxes when you are done dealing with the messages in them.  So the open mailbox windows themselves act as the new mail notification system.\n\nEudora also has a filter action to control whether the user gets notified about messages that match the filter criteria, similar to what this bug is suggesting.  In addition to opening up mailboxes that get new messages that I mention above, you can also have it play a sound and/or put up a generic dialog saying that you have new mail.  You can set the default to do these notifications (or not to) on all messages, and then the filters can override that on a per-message basis.  As a filter action you can even open up messages in to their own separate windows so as to really highlight them.  On Windows Eudora there is a system tray icon that will tell you how many new messages you have, but not any specific message info like TB\'s biff.  In addition Eudora automatically does not notify the user (in any fashion: sound, new mail dialog, or opening mailboxes) on any messages that are marked as junk, or get transferred to the Trash mailbox by a filter.\n',0.00,0,0,3750165,0,NULL,0,'2008-08-22 06:25:19'),(248970,283305,'>Ping?\n\nSorry about the lag, I thought mconnor had been in touch with you.

Enn provided some feedback on it (comment 162), and I\'m waiting for more feedback from Dave Camp (comment 163).\n\nAlso, I think we should add cache handling to the spec, because sensitive data about user\'s private session could be stored on disk as part of the cache, and accessing that data isn\'t that hard (doesn\'t even require manual traversal of cache data files, about:cache comes to rescue!).\n\nPlease let me know what you think!\n\n> We can and will get this into 3.1 one way or another.\n\nThat\'s very good to hear.

If my client sends a double-check request, an unscrupulous list provider could figure out which of the entries in their list it corresponded to at which point they would know either that I had visited that site, or that I had visited a site which hash-collides with it.\n\nThat is a pretty minor leakage, particularly given the strength of the privacy policy google has in place around its collection of data, but it is non-negligible.

Currently the sanitizer (accessible from Tools > Clear Private Data) is able to clear the whole data, not the session specific data.  This is actually a sanitizer thing, and I\'m not sure if it\'s not already filed as a bug.

The undo close tabs (and windows) list will be left untouched in private mode (i.e., the tabs and windows closed in private mode will not be added to them).  When leaving the private mode, all of the windows and tabs that the user had open before entering the private mode will be restored, and undo close tabs/windows list will get updated once again.\n\nBTW, what\'s the bug# tracking the undo close windows work?

Furthermore, it implements the session store handling as laid out in the spec.\n\nFor session store handling, nsSessionStore turns off writing the session data to disk while in private mode, and backs up the restore windows data when entering the private mode, and restores it after leaving it.  Also, it prompts the user if they want to close their current session and open a private session.  If the user says yes, then the current windows and tabs will be closed, and after leaving the private mode, they all will be restored.  If the user says no, their tabs and windows remain open and no restore takes place when leaving the private mode (the behavior of versions prior to 2.4).\n\nThis prompting is implemented in nsBrowserGlue, and can be overrided with the new browser.privatebrowsing.keep_current_session pref.  A mechanism is in place for extensions to override this UI (by handling the \"private-browsing-start\" notification, as I\'ll document in <https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Ehsan/PrivateBrowsingForExtensions>), and the nsBrowserGlue behavior only kicks in when no extension handles this notification.  In case an extension provides its own UI here, the browser.privatebrowsing.keep_current_session will be ignored, and saving user\'s choice (if desired) will be the responsibility of the extension itself.\n\nAt this revision, the patch should be fully compatible with the spec.

Here\'s the relevant code from the patch:\n\n+  _closeAllWindows: function PBS__closeAllWindows() {\n+    let windowMediator = Cc[\"@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1\"].\n+                         getService(Ci.nsIWindowMediator);\n+    let windowsEnum = windowMediator.getEnumerator(\"navigator:browser\");\n+    \n+    this._closeAllWindowsInternal(windowsEnum);\n+  },\n+\n+  _closeAllWindowsInternal: function PBS__closeAllWindowsInternal(windowsEnum) {\n+    if (windowsEnum.hasMoreElements()) {\n+      let window = windowsEnum.getNext();\n+      this._closeAllWindowsInternal(windowsEnum);\n+      window.close();\n+    }\n+  },\n+\n+  _openSingleWindow: function PBS__openSingleWindow() {\n+    let windowWatcher = Cc[\"@mozilla.org/embedcomp/window-watcher;1\"].\n+                        getService(Ci.nsIWindowWatcher);\n+    windowWatcher.openWindow(null, \"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\",\n+                             null, \"chrome,all,resizable=yes,dialog=no\", null);\n+  },\n\n\n\n> Or could you try to restore the browsing state while PB mode isn\'t\n> completely over and we\'re in an inconsistent state overall?\n\nWell, in the private browsing service, I first notify the observers about the exit event, and then call nsSessionStore.setBrowserState to restore the session, so the private browsing mode should be well finished by that time.\n\n(In reply to comment #305)\n> BTW: For the latest try-server build, sessionStorage seems to be broken.

Could\n> this be due to your patch?\n\nYes.  nsDOMStorage::GetLength calls nsDOMStorage::CacheStoragePermissions which itself calls nsDOMStorage::CanUseStorage which returns false in private browsing mode, and hence the NS_ERROR_DOM_SECURITY_ERR exception.  Basically, you can\'t use the dom storage service in the private browsing mode.

All of the modules now call the private browsing service directly to get the current status upon startup.\n3. The private-browsing-query notification, which was merely added for the purpose of not having to depend on nsIPrivateBrowsingService, was removed.\n4. The private-browsing-requested was added.  This notification is sent before entering or leaving the private mode.  Extensions and modules have a chance to cancel this mode if they desire (download manager handles this notification).\n5. The bug which caused session store to save the private session to disk when restarting from within the private mode is fixed.\n6. The bug which caused session store to think the browser has crashed if the user tired to close the browser while still in private mode is fixed.\n7. Latest fixes as per review comments for the cookies and password manager modules are included in this patch.  (The changes requested to passwordmgr unit tests are not included yet).\n8. Aaron\'s unit test for places is now included, making the places module ready for review.\n9. The cookies and httpauth module tests are now splitted.\n10. The latest functional spec for the downloads manager has been implemented in both the back-end and the front-end UI.',0.00,0,0,3811875,0,NULL,0,'2008-10-10 22:11:14'),(248970,251051,'Latest version of the contentprefs module patch.',0.00,0,0,3811924,5,'342661',0,'2008-10-10 22:51:02'),(248970,251051,'Latest version of the cookie patch, with the changes requested in comment 330, and the rest of the review comments.',0.00,0,0,3811926,5,'342662',0,'2008-10-10 22:51:27'),(248970,251051,'The places module patch with a unit test, ready for review.',0.00,0,0,3811930,5,'342664',0,'2008-10-10 22:55:08'),(248970,240353,'(In reply to comment #342)\n> Created an attachment (id=342664) [details]\n> [for review] places v1\n\nwell this is not a review, but some comment on a couple doubts i have, hope it could be useful...\n\n {\n   PRInt64 placeId;\n   nsresult rv = GetPlaceIdForURI(aURI, &placeId);\n   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);\n \n+  if (placeId == -1) // we\'re in private browsing mode\n+    return NS_OK;\n+\n\ni\'m not really sure about this, placeId == -1 imho should throw and not be considered as valid, i fear this could hide other possible bugs or db corruptions.

We won\'t of course make any promises in this regard to users, because we\'re not covering every possible ground here.  The reason that the spec says that reading DOM storage should be blocked as well is to prevent this association.\n\n> My understanding is that this is what other UAs do.

It seems that Chrome doesn\'t support DOM storage though, but I suppose if it did, it would\'ve made the same choice as for the cookies.  Both my patch and Chrome\'s implementation keep history in place.  The only difference in our handling of history is that we turn off visited link coloring in private mode to prevent attacks like <http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/socialhistoryjs/>.\n\n> If this is what we want to do too then I think the spec needs to be changed\n> quite a bit.\n\nIt seems that for the time being, we\'re going to maintain the current spec, and we need to make sure that the implementation follows the spec exactly.',0.00,0,0,3827010,0,NULL,0,'2008-10-23 14:18:08'),(248970,251051,'The session store module changes with tests, ready for review.',0.00,0,0,3827164,5,'344483',0,'2008-10-23 16:28:46'),(248970,160571,'>+    // The Private Browsing service might not be available.\n>+    try {\n>+      var pbs = Cc[\"@mozilla.org/privatebrowsing;1\"].\n>+                getService(Ci.nsIPrivateBrowsingService);\n>+      this._inPrivateBrowsing = pbs.privateBrowsingEnabled;\n>+    } catch (e) {}\n\nIsn\'t the PB service part of /browser as is SessionStore?

There is a potential for the second condition.  For example, the implementation of bug 460346 might cause situations where the enter notification is not received before exit.  Therefore I prefer to keep it, at least as a sanity check, as the case may be.\n\n> >+  _backupRecentlyClosedTabs: function sss_backupRecentlyClosedTabs() {\n> \n> I\'m still opposed to this. ;-)\n\nOK, I\'ve given this extensive thought.  With this implementation, if the user doesn\'t choose to save and close her current session, after leaving the private mode, her browser is exactly at the same state as when entering the private mode.  The same thing happens if she chooses to save and close her session (even without this code).  So, this provides a level of consistency between the two options.\n\nAnother point here is that I\'ve gone to great lengths to make it impossible for a someone to tell whether the private mode has even been entered by inspecting two states of the browser (which might be before and after the private session).  Without this code, this will break.\n\nThirdly, since in the final implementation that we will ship, the option to save and close the current session might be the only available option facing the users, this might not be that debatable.\n\nSo, unless there are technical reasons that we should remove this code, or I\'m doing something wrong in it, I prefer to keep it.\n\n> >+      backup[ix] = eval(this._windows[ix]._closedTabs.toSource());\n> \n> _safeEval!\n\nDone.\n\n> As for the tests, I\'ve unfortunately found some nits as well (many apply to\n> both tests):\n> \n> >+var _PBSvc = null;\n> >+function get_PBSvc() {\n> >+ if (_PBSvc)\n> >+  return _PBSvc;\n> \n> Smart getter, please.\n\nHum?

For example, if a site sets a cookie with\na unique ID the first time you visit it (like Google does) and your browser\nsends that cookie for each request, the website effectively has a log of all\nyour activities associated together.\n\nNow, if your browser send that cookie inside the private mode, the site would\nbe able to associate your public and private activities.

I cannot reproduce this bug reliably enough to investigate it.\n\nThe very first time I tried attaching an image I saw facebook and the gallery app crash.  I think that was after flashing the spreadtrum base image before updating gecko and gaia to the nightly build.  It was also a first run situation so the gallery app was probably busy scanning photos (and therefore using extra memory) when the crash occurred.\n\nSince then, I\'ve never seen facebook crash. Most of my attempts to attach an image are successful. Some of them (10 or 15% of the time, maybe) do not complete: the gallery app must OOM before it can pass the photo back to facebook, and facebook just sits there like I never clicked the attach photo button.\n\nOnce I had a situation where after I\'d selected the photo I returned to the facebook app, but it was just blank gray. Like it was reloading and the server was down or something. I suppose it could have been a bad network connection.  It didn\'t seem like it had crashed, but it wasn\'t responding either.\n\nIn order to load gallery more heavily, I\'ve tried going to camera, taking 10 photos and then opening facebook and trying to attach a photo while the gallery is still scanning photos.  Usually it works.\n\nIf we can get more reliable STR and if it turns out that the issue is related to the scanning process then we have some options.  The easiest thing would probably be to make the gallery not scan for new files when invoked to pick a photo.  So the user would have to use the camera, then run the gallery to scan the photos, then use facebook to select the desired photos to upload.  That seems pretty bad, so I don\'t want to do that unless this really is an easy-to-reproduce bug.\n\nHmm.  Here\'s a thought. I created a test account on facebook to try to reproduce this. It has almost nothing in it. When I launch the facebook app and click to add a picture \'adb shell b2g-ps\' reports something like 78mb of memory being used.  Joe, if you\'re using a real facebook account, perhaps you have lots of content and images opened and maybe your app is using lots more memory.  Could you check that? Open Facebook, and after you click to add a photo, but before you tap on the Gallery button, try \'adb shell b2g-ps\' and see how much memory Facebook is taking.\n\nIf the issue is that Facebook is using too much memory, I\'m not optimistic that we\'ll be able to do much to solve this problem, at least not in Gaia.',0.00,0,0,8818814,0,NULL,0,'2014-05-20 23:44:09'),(1007019,455315,'hi David, sorry for the late response\n\nWith facebook opened and before tapping on photo upload\nAPPLICATION      USER     PID   PPID  VSIZE  RSS     WCHAN    PC         NAME\nb2g              root      86    1     154060 28364 ffffffff 40029518 S /system/b2g/b2g\n(Nuwa)           root      318   86    46824  4468  ffffffff 400df518 S /system/b2g/plugin-container\nFacebook         app_3030  3030  318   83080  34364 ffffffff 400df518 S /system/b2g/plugin-container\n(Preallocated a  root      3073  318   55008  13244 ffffffff 400df724 S /system/b2g/plugin-container\n\nWith facebook opened and after tapping on photo upload\nAPPLICATION      USER     PID   PPID  VSIZE  RSS     WCHAN    PC         NAME\nb2g              root      86    1     155108 34768 ffffffff 40e70ae6 R /system/b2g/b2g\n(Nuwa)           root      318   86    46824  4460  ffffffff 400df518 S /system/b2g/plugin-container\nFacebook         app_3030  3030  318   83692  34200 ffffffff 400df518 S /system/b2g/plugin-container\n(Preallocated a  root      3073  318   55008  12824 ffffffff 40e29740 R /system/b2g/plugin-container',0.00,0,0,8840168,0,NULL,0,'2014-05-26 08:45:21'),(1007019,416398,'Thanks for this data, Joe.

In fact, when I select an image from the camera using Facebook, everything is slow. There is terrible shutter lag--sometimes I wait a second between pressing the shutter before I finally hear the shutter sound.  The camera startup spinner sometimes takes too long to disappear after the camera appears to be ready.  As Fabrice found, sometimes it takes a long time after clicking Confirm to get back to Facebook.  Only 1-2 seconds of this time are the camera app processing the image. Sometimes, the spinner goes away and we just sit there while the system transitions back to facebook from the camera.\n\nMy first guess here is that everything is slow because Facebook\'s memory is being compressed and uncompressed. But I don\'t understand how memory works on Tarako, so I might be off base here. And if so, I don\'t think there is anything we can do about this issue.

People like me, who created a Facebook account just to work on this bug, can not usually reproduce it.  Except when Facebook decides to do something different... Once when I tried testing this, Facebook decided that as a new user it should send me special content (I think it was \"do you know any of these people\"). So even though I have an empty timeline, the Facebook\'s app memory usage went way up and I could reproduce the bug. \n\nAs a general thing, no matter how much memory we can save, there is always going to be someone\'s extra busy facebook page that will use too much memory for Tarako. The same is true of any website. It is a low-spec device, and some content will just be too big for it. The facebook app is a memory-hungry black box. We cannot make it never crash. In order to solve this bug we might want to just pick a number and call that good enough. Maybe the requirement is that the user is able to select a photo from the camera app if the facebook app is using 75mb of memory or less.  And if Facebook is larger than that we offer no guarantees.\n\nFrom Naoki\'s work reported in comment #40 we know that modifying the value of the image.mem.max_decoded_image_kb preference seems to make a difference, at least once we get it down to 10000 or below.

Milan: can you or someone on your team weigh in on what a reasonable value of this pref would be for this low-memory device?  What are the possible consequences of setting it too low? \n\nOther thoughts:\n\n- Comment #56 makes it sound like we actually have a swap partition on this device. I didn\'t know that. Can we increase the size of the partition? Danny, is that something you could comment on?\n\n- The tricky thing in all of this is keeping the Facebook app alive while the Camera or Gallery apps run as activities. Neither Camera nor Gallery are small apps. Is there any way we can modify our activity launching code to interact with our memory management code?  When we launch Camera or Gallery can we first ensure that the Facebook app is fully swapped out? Or could we send a memory pressure event before launching an activity to give Gecko some advance notice of the coming memory squeeze? I have no idea if this is plausible or not. Anyone have ideas here?\n\n- Perhaps as a stop-gap we could impose some kind of free memory requirement before launching an activity. If the foreground app is using more than some number of mb of memory, then we don\'t allow it to launch an activity and instead display a message to the user? Users would lose features, but at least it wouldn\'t be via mysterious OOMs.  Can we actually do this? Can the activity code in Gecko (which I think is written in JavaScript) get access to process memory usage information?  This might be the best we can do: to fail with an explanatory message rather than failing with no message.\n\n- Or could we modify memory management for activities so that it is the requesting app that stays alive and the activity handler app that gets killed? The user still wouldn\'t be able to attach a photo, but at least they\'d still have their facebook page open. This would only really make sense if the system app had a way to detect the \'activity-failed-with-OOM\' case and display an error message.',0.00,0,0,8923116,0,NULL,0,'2014-06-12 17:41:13'),(1007019,486267,'(In reply to David Flanagan [:djf] from comment #75)\n> - Or could we modify memory management for activities so that it is the\n> requesting app that stays alive and the activity handler app that gets\n> killed?
